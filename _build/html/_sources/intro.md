# SustainOSS Governance Handbook

This notebook is for collecting information related to governance in open source.

## How to use this website

At its heart, this is a simple Jupyter notebook that can display information in a structured format. Jupyter Notebooks have a long history of use for documenting software and research methods - there are also other groups, like [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html), that use these notebooks for providing resources on how to work collaboratively in the open.

## Contribute

This work cannot be done by a single person or a single team. There are several ways to contribute:

- [**Open an issue**](https://github.com/sustainers/academic-map/issues/new) to add data. If you are unsure how to use Git easily or you are unsure where something goes, just open an issue with your suggestions or comments. 
- Add a page directly to the Git repository using a **Pull Request**. The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/sustainers/academic-map/).
- **Complain**. If this isn't working for you, tell us why, and we'd be more than happy to work to make it better.
- **Join** the calls. These are announced in [the Sustain Discourse](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/).
- **Send an email.** Richard Littauer is the main editor for this repository, at the moment, and he's happy to incorporate any changes or to build a more welcoming and inclusive structure for collaboration here if any of the above options is less than ideal. Email [richard@sustainoss.org](mailto:richard@sustainoss.org).
