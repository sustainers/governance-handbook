# Individuals

As with so many other fields, open source in academia is ofter driven by individuals, as opposed to permanent projects and institutions. Especially with hyperconnectors, knowing who to talk to and their context can be invaluable. While this website can never hope to be a rolodex of everyone relevant in the field of open source software in academia, having some pages here can potentially be useful. 

If you have shown up for a SustainOSS Academic Working Group call and if you would like to have yourself listed here as someone interested in open source in academia, please add your information below. This list is both publicly available and editable; feel free to make a PR to add or remove yourself at any time.

By adding your name in a PR below, you are in the least saying that you are willing to be contacted about topics related to open source in academia, especially concerning open source sustainability. Do not add the names of other individuals without their explicit consent, in order to conform to GDPR.

## List

_To keep it simple, limit your details to one paragraph, starting with your name (followed by a period), and including organization or institution, and any contactable social profile or website._
