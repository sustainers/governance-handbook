## General Description

The Johns Hopkins University Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) is a team of experts dedicated to helping the JHU community make the most of open source software. We believe open source software is a powerful tool for solving global problems, and we are here to support its use and development at JHU.

We do this by providing education and resources, curating open source software developed by JHU faculty, staff, and students, defining and sharing best practices, and illustrating the value of open source software developed at JHU. 

## Core Objectives
 
- Building awareness of the value and impact of open source within the university.  
- Providing resources, tools, and engineering support to promote the use of open source within the university's academic community. 
- Supporting the participation of faculty, staff, and students in open source through educational programs, information sharing, and guidance on best practices. 
- Encouraging the translation of academic discovery into products and services that generate social impact in addition to commercial success.
