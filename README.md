# Governance Handbook

> A Jupyter Book of resources for governance in open source

## Usage

Go to the website where this is rendered. Currently, that is https://sustainers.github.io/governance-handbook/. You can also build this locally - see below.

## Install

This is a Jupyter notebook, and depends on the tooling system of Jupyter Notebooks to work. https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html has an excellent intro to get started. For now:

- Clone this repository locally.
- Edit any Markdown locally.
- Add any pages that you want to be in the Table of Contents to `_toc.yml`.
- Run `build.sh` in order to automatically build the changes. You may need to run `chmod +x build.sh` to make this executable, first.

## Contribute

Please! All contributions are welcome. As is written in the intro page currently:

- [**Open an issue**](https://github.com/sustainers/academic-map/issues/new) to add data. If you are unsure how to use Git easily or you are unsure where something goes, just open an issue with your suggestions or comments. 
- Add a page directly to the Git repository using a **Pull Request**. The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/sustainers/governance-handbook/).
- **Complain**. If this isn't working for you, tell us why, and we'd be more than happy to work to make it better.
- **Join** the calls. These are announced in [the Sustain Discourse](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/).
- **Send an email.** Richard Littauer is the main editor for this repository, at the moment, and he's happy to incorporate any changes or to build a more welcoming and inclusive structure for collaboration here if any of the above options is less than ideal. Email [richard@sustainoss.org](mailto:richard@sustainoss.org).
